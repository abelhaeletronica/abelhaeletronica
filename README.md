Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

About Me
Hello, I'm a Brazilian artist and ceramics teacher with a background in architecture and urban planning. My passion for Eastern ceramics was cultivated during a residency in Kyoto, where I explored the depths of traditional craftsmanship and cultural aesthetics. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Glass and Ceramic Art and Science at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, blending my love for traditional materials with modern technology.

My Projects
This repository hosts a collection of my projects where art meets technology. Here, you will find:

Interactive art installations combining ceramics and digital interfaces.
Generative art pieces that use algorithms to simulate natural randomness and chaos in artistic forms.
Experimental uses of materials, integrating digital projections and traditional ceramics.
Collaborations
I am open to collaborations and would love to connect with other artists, technologists, and researchers. If you are interested in combining art with cutting-edge technology or have ideas on how we can innovate within the space of traditional arts using modern tools, please feel free to reach out.
